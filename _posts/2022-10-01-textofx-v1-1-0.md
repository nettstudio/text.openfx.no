## FAQ

### macOS/Linux support?

Due to how library loading works on macOS/Linux it's hard to provide generic builds. TextOFX requires and modifies some libraries that may be in conflict with the host application. Since we can't load different versions of the same library we either end up with a broken plug-in or a broken host.

There are ways to get around this, but at the moment it's too much work to provide generic builds on macOS/Linux.

Contact us for custom builds.
